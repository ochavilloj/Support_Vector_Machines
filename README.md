# Homeownership Prediction Using Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Overview

This project leverages Support Vector Machine (SVM) models to identify key predictors of homeownership within a large, well-documented dataset. The analysis explores both continuous and categorical variables, requiring careful preprocessing and encoding techniques. The goal is to determine which factors most strongly influence the ability to own a home, with a focus on both the mathematical results and their broader societal implications.

## Project Components

- **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset consists of 23 variables, some of which are repeated or cleaned versions of others. Given the size of the dataset, subsetting and careful handling of categorical variables were necessary. Categorical data, such as marital status, was encoded appropriately for SVM analysis.

- **Modeling:** The project focuses on SVMs, with particular attention paid to tuning parameters and other key considerations discussed in class. The report includes detailed explanations of the methods used, as well as the reasoning behind each decision.

- **Visualizations:** At least one plot demonstrating an SVM decision boundary is included, providing a visual representation of the model's classification process. This plot helps to illustrate how different predictor variables contribute to the classification of homeownership.

- **Discussion and Conclusions:** The findings from the SVM model are analyzed to determine which variables are strong predictors of homeownership. The discussion extends to the societal challenges surrounding access to housing, and suggestions for policymakers are provided based on the results.
